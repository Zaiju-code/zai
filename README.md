# Z.A.I.
Zaiju's Arch Installer

### Usage
**HEAVILY WIP**    
Currently the design is for you to preconfigure the values of '0_config' to taste. 

Then use '0_generate_pkglists.fish' to generate a list of your currently installed Arch packages which can then be reinstalled as part of the installation process.

Overall the design goal is for the user to preconfigure everything in advanced and only have to enter minimal information during installation for things we absolutely can't avoid (like passwords).

Currently contains a total of 2378 lines of code in a mix of bash and fish.
